The following analysis explores standardized test scores for math and reading, as well as the overall passing rate for both subjects, in order to identify trends and inform strategic budgeting decisions for the city's school district. Specifically, the analysis considers the impact of school size, per student spending, and whether the school is a district or charter school on student performance. The findings of this analysis can provide insight into areas where the district may need to allocate more resources or implement targeted interventions to improve student outcomes.

Based on the analysis of the district-wide standardized test results, there are several trends in school performance that can be identified:

1. Schools with lower per student spending have higher overall passing rates: The schools with the lowest per student spending (<$585) had the highest overall passing rate at 90.4%. In that same spending range, students had the highest average math and reading scores, as well as the highest percentage of students passing both subjects.
2. Schools with higher per student spending have lower overall passing rates: Schools in the highest per student spending range ($645-680) had the lowest overall passing rate at 53.5%. These schools also had the lowest average scores and the lowest percentage of students passing both reading and math.
3. Large schools have lower average scores and passing rates: Large schools (2000-5000 students) had the lowest average scores for both reading and math, as well as the lowest percentage of students passing each subject and the overall passing rate.
4. Small and medium schools perform similarly: Small schools (<1000 students) had the highest math and reading scores, while medium schools (1000-2000 students) had the highest percentage of students passing each subject and the overall passing rate. The difference in performance between small and medium schools was minimal.
5. Charter schools outperform district schools: Charter schools performed significantly better than district schools in all categories. The top five schools by overall passing rate were charter schools, while the lowest five performing schools were district schools.
